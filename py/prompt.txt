- Meditation (bhavana) - observing the movements of mind’s attention moment-to-moment, object-to-object for the purpose of seeing clearly the impersonal process of Dependent Origination and the Four Noble Truths.
- Mindfulness (sati) - ‘Remembering’ to observe the movements of mind’s attention.
- Awareness/Observation (sampajana) – Understanding what mind is doing; meaning whether it releasing what is arising, or getting involved with it? It is the true practicing of the 6R’s – That is: Recognizing the movements of mind’s attention, or is it moving into craving and clinging. It is Releasing, Relaxing, Re-smiling and then Returning to the object of meditation to Repeating or continuing with mindfulness.
- Object of Meditation – Any object of meditation we choose is to become the home-base for centering during our meditation. The information we seek will not be found in the object of meditation we observe, but rather it is our recognition of the impersonal Process of Dependent Origination that leads to our knowledge and vision. This occurs around the object of meditation.
- Hindrances (nivarana) - unwholesome tendencies that begin with an arising feeling that is the same as any other feelings and should be treated in the same way during the meditation by practicing the 6R’s - Releasing and relaxing them and not placing mind’s attention on them in any way. By denying them mind’s attention they will become weak and fade away.
- Jhana - The definition here of “Jhana” in Buddhist terms is a "stage of meditation through understanding (the interconnectedness of the Four Noble Truths and Dependent Origination) and seeing how mind actually works." Level of understanding; stage of the meditation path
- Craving (tanha) - the weak link in the process of Dependent Origination, which manifests as tension and tightness in mind and body as it is first appearing. The common definition for the word Craving is “to want or desire,” but there is much more to this word. According to the Buddha there is a definite pattern with everything that arises. For instance, in order "to see" there is a set way things happen. First, there must be a functioning sense door such as the eye.Next there must be color and form. When the eye hits color and form then eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of these three things is called eye-contact. With eye-contact as condition eye-feeling arises (Feeling [Vedana] is pleasant, painful or neither painful nor pleasant and this is either physical or mental feeling).With eye-feeling as condition, then eye-craving arises.
- No-self (anatta) - Impersonal Nature; Impersonal perspective. An absence of taking anything personally, which occurs during life. Seeing things purely as they are without the arising of craving is the beginning of anatta. To do this in life, you don’t have to stop using the pronouns in your language! And you don’t have to try to disappear. Promise.
- Delusion (moha) – In some Buddhist traditions the word "Delusion" (Moha) is linked up with two other words, which are “Lust” (lobha) and “Hatred” (dosa). Together these three words are sometimes called "the three poisons." This actually is a reasonable way to look at them. But there is some confusion about what "Delusion" (Moha) actually means.The Buddha meant something a little bit different every time he used this word.According to the suttas the word “Delusion” (Moha) means to see whatever arises as being a personal self (atta). Or we can say that “Delusion” (Moha) is seeing things through the false (deluded) idea of a self (atta). In other words, one takes all feelings or sensations to be a part of the "I," "Me," “My,” "Mine" (atta) identification, that is Delusion.
- Serenity (samatha) - Here again is another word to look at.In Pali the word is Samatha. The meaning of Samatha is tranquility, serenity, peacefulness, stillness, or collectedness. Often the common popular definition is a strongly one-pointed type of concentration, absorption concentration, or ecstatic concentration. This specific definition of serenity or tranquility certainly implies a different type of "collectedness" than the deeper types of absorption or ecstatic concentration. The goal of absorption or ecstatic concentration is to have mind stay on only one thing as if it were glued to it (to the exclusion of anything else).
- Insight (vipassana) – This word has a surface meaning, which is “seeing things as they truly are.” According to the Buddha, the definition goes much deeper than that. “Insight” or understanding into what? Insight refers to “realizing the impersonal nature and deeply understanding of the Four Noble Truths and HOW Dependent Origination actually occurs with everything that arises and passes away (anicca) in one’s mind and body.” In other words, one gains a deeper and deeper understanding (in each stage of Jhana) of the impersonal process of HOW mind and body arises through truly seeing and understanding (knowledge and vision) of the Four Noble Truths interconnection with the ongoing processes of Dependent Origination. When one can see clearly these processes in all of existence, they will experience an unshakable knowledge that this is the right path to follow.
- Wisdom (panna) – there are many phrases within the suttas using the word ‘wisdom’ and they usually turn out, in some context or other, to be concerning “the impersonal process of Dependent Origination.”Anytime the words “Wise Attention” or “Wisdom” is seen in the suttas they are referring to the understanding of the Four Noble Truths and the process of Dependent Origination. Other such phrases appear as: “He sees with Wisdom,” ”Seeing with Wisdom,” “And his taints were destroyed by his seeing with Wisdom,” “Wisdom,” or “He is Wise.”
- Collectedness (samadhi) - The Pali word actually means the unification or bringing together of mind. The word ”Collectedness” appears to be more functional for success in the meditation rather than the word ”Concentration.” Here in the West people take the word ”Concentration” to mean a kind of deep, one-pointedness of mind or an absorbed mind, and this is not what the Buddha was trying to get across. Before the time of the Buddha there were many words that described deep absorption or one-pointedness of mind.
